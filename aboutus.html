 <h3> What is SCAT? </h3>
	<p> We have designed the Student Codable Aquatic Traveler or S-CAT. 
	It is a small machine that has a ARDUINO, Camera, and any sensors you want. 
	Its ultimate goal is to allow students to program their own robot so that they can learn through hands-on engineering. 
	The S-CAT has four propeller mounts and an attachment for an ethernet cable to control the robot. 
	It is an individually battery powered device that provides video of the S-CATâ€™s journey when connected to a computer. 
	The camera is always filming through livestream footage.
	The goal is that students, with this device, will gain a newfound interest in marine science and engineering.
